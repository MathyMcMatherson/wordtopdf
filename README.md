### What This Does

You have a folder with lots of .docx files (like after a mail-merge, or from downloading reports, or after making a bunch of worksheets). You need them as .pdf files. This script will convert all .docx files in a folder into .pdf files.

### How-To

- Open the .ps1 file in a text editor (like notepad)
- Replace the text in the first line with the folder that you have all of your .docx files in
- Save the .ps1 file
- Right-click on the .ps1 file and select 'Run With Powershell'

Note: this probably won't work on school computers, but will probably work on home computers
